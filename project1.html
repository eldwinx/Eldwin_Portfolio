            <h2>My process</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Our team started off by ideating the genre of the game we wanted to tackle. After considering our constraints on both technical side and also art assets, we came to the conclusion that we wanted to create a 2D platformer game that is heavily mechanics focused.</p>
            <br>
            <p>After understanding what our team decided to do, as the overall game director, I started ideation by simply drawing out the mechanics that I wanted to implement for this game, which later happened to be shapeshifting.</p>

      <section class = "flex_section_project">
        <div class="flex_container_2">
          <div class="flex_item_big">
            <p>Our team had multiple meetings for both art assets and coding over the months. We had 3 milestone which includes multiple playtesting session. With that feedback, we were able to improve our game by adding/removing parts of the game and also fixed many bugs.</p>
            <br>
            <p>As the project manager was to make sure that everyone in the team was on the right track, provide feedback, set up meeting/deadlines and communicate with playtesters. My second task was to do part of the level design for my team. Also, since my team was lacking on art assets, I was able to learn some basic digital drawing and provide most of the art asset for the team; this includes all the foreground assets and also the UIs. Lastly, although I am not the main programmer, I was able to provide assistant on coding by doing part of the mechanics.</p>
