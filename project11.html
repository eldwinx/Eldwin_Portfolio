            <h3>The goal of Diary-A is to create a platform which promotes healthy lifestyle and allows people to track their steps. As a workout application, the application acquires pedometer, which allows the user to record their steps. Not only that, we created a scientific mathematical formula, that allow us to calculate how much calories the user has burnt during the day. The data will then be transmitted onto a graph which stores up to 6 hours of data for the user to compare and contrast. The application also has multiple side features such as websites that are related to healthy living and weather of the day. </h3>

            <h2>My process</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Our team started the project by designing what type of application that we want to create. After a long discussion, we came to the conclusion that we wanted to create a health-related application. We started by creating a site-map, planning out how the user would interact with the application. This site-map also allows us to understand the flow of the application, giving us the chance to make sure that the application is easy to navigate.</p>
            <br>
            <p>After understanding what we wanted to create, we moved onto the programming section. We put our focus on the main feature first, which is the tracking diagrams. We used phone's built-in pedometer to track how many steps the user took and saved it into a SQL database. We then created a bar diagram to showcase the hourly difference. This allows the user to compare their exercise throughout the day. </p>
            <br>
          </div>

          <div class="flex_item_small">
              <div class="img_box_small"><img src="./img/diary_2.jpg" alt="work1"/></div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section class = "flex_section_project">
        <div class="flex_container_2">
          <div class="flex_item_big">
            <p>We continued off by thinking about the accuracy of our application. Since every user would have different height and weight, that means that the calories that they would be burning would be different. In order to accurately present to the user the number of calories they burned throughout the day, we had to allow the user to input their personal weight and height.
            </p><br>
            <p>After having those features, we spent most of our time finishing up the application. This includes adding additional side feature, for example, closest food shop near me, health exercise instruction website, etc. We finished up our application by adding in loading screen (to make sure that the app doesn't lag) and also make sure the navigation works.

            <br>
            <p>This is a great project since I was able to learn a lot about Android Studio and also design for an application. We were able to receive very positive feedback from the user testing and it was overall a success. Thank you for reading!
