It is about two domino pieces woke up at late night and start playing around and one accidentally pushed over the other. After realizing what just happened, they witnessed the whole room was going down with a "domino effect".</h3>

            <h2>My process</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Our team started off this project by ideating what kind of story we want to tell. After multiple discussion and meetings, our team came to the conclusion that we wanted to aim for a comedy short which feels and looks like a Pixar style. We continued by sketching out our characters and their own personality. We also did some sketching for our environment as well. Not only that, we created a storyboard on how we wanted the animation short to be like. </p>
            <br>
            <p>After having everything written down, I started my progress by making the environment in Maya. It was a fun task since I was able to learn a lot about Maya program and I was also able to touch on some ncloth which is very fun to use. After finishing the environment, I continued on by creating the character model. My main challenge was to make sure that all of its body parts are easily movable for rigging and animation. </p>

          <div class="flex_item_small">
              <div class="img_box_small"><img src="./img/render_1.jpg" alt="work1"/></div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section class = "flex_section_project">
        <div class="flex_container_2">
          <div class="flex_item_big">
            <p>Later on, I sent the character model to our character rigging member, and I continued my work on playing around with the lighting and the material within the environment. After receiving a fully rigged character, I started to test around with the animation. I created multiple character animation scenes with cameras that cover multiple angles of the character.
            </p><br>
            <p>After having the character animation done, I started working on the sound to make sure that it fits our narrative. Since we do not have any voice actors, we had to rely on free sound online. Our main challenge was actually time. When we reached to the end of the project, we didn't have enough time to render everything, therefore, multiple animations and story was unfortunately cut out of the project.

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Overall, I love this project. Although it is really time-consuming, it had opened my eyes to 3D animation and I totally enjoy doing them. If we had more time, we probably would render everything out, but I am still proud of what we have accomplished. This is our team website <a href="http://eldwinx.wixsite.com/343oops">http://eldwinx.wixsite.com/343oops</a>.Thank you for reading, and here's the animation short. Hope you enjoy!
