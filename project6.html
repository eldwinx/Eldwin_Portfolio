            <h2>My process</h2>
            <br>
            <p>I started the project by creating a style guide. By using the style guide, I could clearly understand what type of design I want for individual elements. This includes coloring, grid/flexbox system, font size, and style, etc.. After that, we started discussing the pages that we need for the website (how the user would flow through our web pages). As the main programmer, I started by creating the template for the website, having basic HTML/CSS setup to showcase where each individual element goes and how they would look when they are together.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I continued the website by adding more styling; this includes most of the CSS animation and coloring while also adding in some simple JavaScript into the page. After that, we did some usability tests with our peers, this allows us to understand which pages are important to the user and how they would get there (how many clicks, is it obvious, etc.). After receiving that valuable information, I continued off by finishing the website. </p>
            <br>

          <div class="flex_item_small">
              <div class="img_box_small"><img src="./img/sq_1.jpg" alt="work1"/></div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section class = "flex_section_project">
        <div class="flex_container_2">
          <div class="flex_item_big">
            <p>After I finished the website for medium screen size, I was tasked to continue off by making it responsive for mobile size. Here's where I met my main challenges, I had to tweak around a lot of spacing issues while also making sure it works for different mobile phones. Later on, I was also able to add in some of the content that was needed for the website.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Overall, the project was a great success. It allows me to further improve my HTML and CSS ability. Although I still feel that my code is a little bit messy, it is surely a huge improvement from my previous projects considering how much time we were given to complete it. </p>
