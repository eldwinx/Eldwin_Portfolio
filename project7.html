            <h2>My process</h2>
            <br>
            <p>To start off my project, I put my main focus on learning how SQL and PHP work and how they interact with each other. After gaining some basic knowledge of how similar PHP is to HTML and how SQL database works through both online material and course studies, I started off by ideating what type of website I wanted to create. Since I have been always interested in a website such as ArtStation, I wanted to create a simple art gallery website where everyone can post their art pieces and comment on others. This is basically the premise of the website.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I continued off by designing the basic wireframe of the website, this includes the general location where each element would be placed, how would the elements interact with each other, and also user's flow through the website. </p>
            <br>
          </div>

          <div class="flex_item_small">
              <div class="img_box_small"><img src="./img/art_2.jpg" alt="work1"/></div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section class = "flex_section_project">
        <div class="flex_container_2">
          <div class="flex_item_big">
            <p> After that, I spent a whole week doing the front-end of the website, basically moved my design into PHP/HTML and stylized it to my pleasing. Front-end was done relatively fast, however, I met my challenges when I reached the back-end part. Technical problems with the connection between front and back end have been there throughout the whole progression of the website. I had to do a lot of research and cut a lot of content in order to overcome those challenges within the time frame.</p><br>
            <p>After understanding how storing pictures and text into a dataset works, I wanted to add a customizable banner for the user, which gives the user their personal experience on the website. I continued by doing multiple user testing to make sure that the website has a fluent flow between each page. So overall, the website allows the user to create their unique account which is encrypted; the user is allowed to upload any images that they want and it will be stored in the user's account; the user is able to customize their own banner which changes the home page of the website; the user is allowed to filter through multiple types of art style simply by click on the checkbox on the left; last but now least, the user would be able to leave comments to other users.</p>

            <br>
            <p>The project sure had been a fun ride for me, I was able to learn how back-end and front-end interact with each other and it was both interesting and challenging for me. Since the website was mostly hosted locally, if you are interested in the site, feel free to contact me for more information.
