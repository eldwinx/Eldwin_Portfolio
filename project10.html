            <h2>My process</h2>
            <br>
            <p>This is probably the hardest/most time-consuming project that I have ever been in. Since the course is mainly about spatial design/interior design, our team started off the project by visiting multiple design buildings within Seattle. We had to come up with multiple different unique designs within the 3 days we were there. We were able to create over 10 designs and presented them to our professor.  </p>
            <br>
            <p>However, everything did not go as smoothly as we wanted it to be. During the first feedback, our project was determined as dull and not inspiring. The whole team's mentality was at an all-time low. We had to overhaul all our progression and redo basically the whole thing. As the team leader, I had to make sure that our team was moving in the right direction. </p>

          </div>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section class = "flex_section_project">
        <div class="flex_container_2">
          <div class="flex_item_big">
            <p>After having multiple research session, we bounced back stronger than before. During the second presentation, our professor was very happy about our progression and the overhaul was a complete success.
            </p><br>
            <p>This is just the first step, with my other modeler, we continued off our work by creating a digital space within Sketchup. We had to make sure that everything is human-scaled, and every furniture is placed to show off space within the environment. After that, I started on trying out multiple rendering techniques and adding on different textures to make sure that the environment looks realistic. We also added multiple lighting for each scene to make sure that it looks as natural as possible. It took me multiple tries to make sure everything was just the way I wanted it to be.

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Overall, this project was a great success. I was able to learn a lot about spatial design, 3D modeling, and graphics design. Not only that, this project probably is the biggest group that I have ever led. I was able to learn a lot about leadership skill and communication skill. Thank you for reading!
