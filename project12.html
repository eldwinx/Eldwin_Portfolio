            <h3>EchooLab, specifically 'Echooplace' was a marketing demo which I made for the company. The main point of this project is to first demonstrate to the fellow employees the future of Echoolab; the second usage of this project was to attract business investors and showcase the potential of our company. I would not be going in-depth of what exactly is 'Echooplace', also, I couldn't share any pictures related to the project. I'll be mainly going through the steps that I took to reach to the final.</h3>

            <h2>My process</h2>
            <br>
            <p>I started off the project by having many meetings with the CEO, Mr. Han. He expressed to me what exactly the type of product he wanted to create in the future for his company. We had multiple heated discussion and finally, we were able to narrow it down to a few points. I took what we discussed within the meeting and started my iteration. I started off by simply sketching on paper, stating out all the features I think that might be required in order to fulfill Mr. Han's vision. After that, I took what I drew and had another meeting with Mr. Han. Surprisingly, Mr. Han was very satisfied with the product, therefore, I proceed into the second phase. I continued the project by drafting multiple versions of the product out on Adobe XD, each with its own style. </p>
            <br>
            <p>After having around 5 versions, I brought them to Mr. Han again, and he chose one that he specifically liked. After receiving the feedback, I continued by editing the material and the features. I also went to the other designer for suggestions and she was able to provide a lot of valuable feedback. Lastly, I made sure that the demo is interactive for the investor, so they would be able to tell exactly how the product would work. The total demo was around 29 screens. </p>

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Overall, the project was a great success. The investors were very satisfied with the product, and the company was able to receive a good amount of funding from them. Mr. Han was very supportive and put all his trusts on me, I am very thankful for that, and hopefully, I did not disappoint. Unfortunately, I am not able to showcase any picture of the project.
