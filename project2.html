            <h2>My process</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Although we only had 4 months to complete this game, our team wanted to challenge ourselves to create an action adventure game that focuses on both combat and narrative. My role within the group is the game director, character modeler/animator, and project manager.</p>
            <br>
            <p>As the game manager/director, I had daily individual/group meeting with each of my members. With that, I was able to stay up to date on the process and made sure everyone was on the right track. I also tasked everyone with the assignment that they have to finish by the end of the week. Lastly, I did most the documents that were needed for the project which includes weekly blogs, playtest documents, and game direction document.</p>

            <p>As the character modeler/animator, since we wanted to create everything from scratch, I started off by sketching and researching what I wanted our character to look like. Although I have never tackled 3D character modeling, I was able to accomplish what we needed for the model. Since we are lacking on people, I put my focus on enemy modeling as well to make sure that the game has a wide variety of enemies. After that, I focused on researching the animations that we needed and videotaped myself acting them out. After countless hours, I was able to finish all the animations that were needed for both main character and enemies.</p>
            <br>
            <p>As a team, we also did multiple playtesting sessions and we also presented our greenlight presentation to both our professors and field experts. With that valuable feedback, we were able to iterate over and over again until we reached our time limit.</p>
